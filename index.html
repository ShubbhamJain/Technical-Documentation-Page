          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <!-- <h2>About Java</h2> -->
        </header>

        <h3>About the Java Technology</h3>
        <p>Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.</p>

        <h4>The Java Programming Language</h4>
        <p>
          The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:
          <ul>
            <li>Simple
            <li>Object oriented</li>
            <li>Distributed</li>
            <li>Multithreaded</li>
            <li>Dynamic</li>
            <li>Architecture neutral</li>
            <li>Portable</li>
            <li>High performance</li>
            <li>Robust</li>
            <li>Secure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension.
          Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler.
          A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes —
          the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine1 (Java VM).
          The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.</p>

          <p>Because the Java VM is available on many different operating systems, the same .class files are capable of running on
          Microsoft Windows, the Solaris™ Operating System (Solaris OS), Linux, or Mac OS. Some virtual machines,
          such as the Java SE HotSpot at a Glance, perform additional steps at runtime to give your application a performance boost.
          This includes various tasks such as finding performance bottlenecks and recompiling (to native code) frequently used sections of code.
          </p>
        </p>

        <h4>The Java Platform</h4>
        <p>
          A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs. We've already mentioned some of the most popular
          platforms like Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris OS, and Mac OS. Most platforms can be described as a combination of the
          operating system and underlying hardware. The Java platform differs from most other platforms in that it's a
          software-only platform that runs on top of other hardware-based platforms.
          <br><br>
          The Java platform has two components:
          <ul>
            <li>The Java Virtual Machine</li>
            <li>The Java Application Programming Interface (API)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You've already been introduced to the Java Virtual Machine; it's the base for
          the Java platform and is ported onto various hardware-based platforms.</p>
          <p>The API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities.
          It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces; these libraries are known as packages.
          The next section, What Can Java Technology Do? highlights some of the functionality provided by the API.</p>
          <p>As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.
          However, advances in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of
          native code without threatening portability.</p>

        <p>
          The process of Java programming can be simplified in three steps:
          <ul>
            <li>Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file – HelloWorld.java.</li>
            <li>Compile it by typing “javac HelloWorld.java” in the terminal window.</li>
            <li>Execute (or run) it by typing “java HelloWorld” in the terminal window.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <h1>Variables in Java</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.
          <ul>
            <li>The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.</li>
            <li>A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.</li>
            <li>In Java, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
        <code>int data = 20;</code>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Int is datatype.datatype: Type of data that can be stored in this variable.</li>
            <li>Data is variable_name.variable_name: Name given to the variable.</li>
            <li>20 is value.value: It is the initial value stored in the variable.</li>

          <h1>Data Types</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:
          <ul>
            <li>Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.</li>
            <li>Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Java Primitive Data Types</h3>
        <p>
          In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation.
          These are the most basic data types available in Java language.
          <ul>
            <li>boolean data type</li>
            <li>byte data type</li>
            <li>char data type</li>

          Operator in Java is a symbol which is used to perform operations. For example: +, -, *, / etc.<br>
          There are many types of operators in Java which are given below:
          <ul>
            <li>Unary Operator</li>

        </header>
        <p>
          The Java if statement is used to test the condition.
          It checks boolean condition: true or false. There are various types of if statement in Java.
          <ul>
            <li>if statement</li>
            <li>if-else statement</li>
            <li>if-else-if ladder</li>
            <li>nested if statement</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Java if Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The Java if statement tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true.
        </p>
        <code>
          if(condition){
            //code to be executed
          }
        </code>
        <h3>Java if-else Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The Java if-else statement also tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true otherwise else block is executed.
        </p>
        <code>
          if(condition){
          //code if condition is true
          }else{
          //code if condition is false
          }
        </code>
        <h3>Java if-else-if ladder Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The if-else-if ladder statement executes one condition from multiple statements.
        </p>
        <code>
          if(condition1){
          //code to be executed if condition1 is true
          }else if(condition2){
          //code to be executed if condition2 is true
          }
          else if(condition3){
          //code to be executed if condition3 is true
          }
          ...
          else{
          //code to be executed if all the conditions are false
          }
        </code>
        <h3>Java Nested if statement</h3>
        <p>
          The nested if statement represents the if block within another if block.
          Here, the inner if block condition executes only when outer if block condition is true.
        </p>
        <code>
          if(condition){
            //code to be executed
              if(condition){
                //code to be executed
              }
          }

          <h1>Loops in Java</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          In programming languages, loops are used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when
          some conditions become true. There are three types of loops in Java.
          <ul>
            <li>For Loop</li>
            <li>While Loop</li>
            <li>Do-while Loop</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Java For Loop</h3>
        <p>
          The Java for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of
          iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop.<br>
          There are three types of for loops in java.
          <ul>
            <li>Simple For Loop</li>
            <li>For-each or Enhanced For Loop</li>
            <li>Labeled For Loop</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Simple For Loop declaration</h4>
        <code>
          for(initialization;condition;incr/decr){
          //statement or code to be executed
          }
        </code>

        <h3>Java While Loop</h3>
        <p>
          The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times.
          If the number of iteration is not fixed, it is recommended to use while loop.
        </p>
        <h4>Simple While Loop declaration</h4>
        <code>
          initialization
          while(condition){
          //code to be executed
          incr/decr
          }
        </code>

        <h3>Java do-while Loop</h3>
        <p>
          The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times.
          If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use do-while loop.
          The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body.
        </p>
        <h4>Simple While Loop declaration</h4>
        <code>
          initialization
          do{
          //code to be executed
          incr/decr
          }while(condition);

          <h1>Objects and Classes</h1>
          <!-- <p>In object-oriented programming technique, we design a program using objects and classes.
            An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.</p> -->
        </header>
        <h2>Objects</h2>
        <p>
          An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc.
          It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.<br>
          An object has three characteristics:
          <ul>
            <li>State</li>
            <li>Behavior</li>
            <li>Identity</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>
          A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which
          objects are created. It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.<br>
          A class in Java can contain:
          <ul>
            <li>Fields</li>
            <li>Methods</li>
            <li>Constructors</li>
            <li>Blocks</li>
            <li>Nested class and interface</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Class Delaration</h4>
        <code>
          class <class_name>{
              field;
              method;
          }
        </code>

        <h4>Object and Class Example</h4>
        <p>
          In this example, we have created a Student class which has two data members id and name.
          We are creating the object of the Student class by new keyword and printing the object's value.<br>
          Here, we are creating a main() method inside the class.
        </p>
        <code>
          //Java Program to illustrate how to define a class and fields<br>
          //Defining a Student class.<br>

          <h1>Constructors in Java</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created.
          At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.<br><br>
          It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.<br><br>
          Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.<br><br>
          It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class.
          In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.<br><br>
          There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.
        </p>

        <h3>Java Default Constructor</h3>
        <p>A constructor is called "Default Constructor" when it doesn't have any parameter.</p>
        <code>
          class class_name{<br>
            class_name(){<br>
              //code to be executed<br>
            }<br>
            public static void main(String args[]){<br>
              //calling a default constructor<br>
              class_name object_name=new class_name();<br>
            }<br>
          }
        </code>

        <h3>Java Parameterized Constructor</h3>
        <p>A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.</p>
        <code>
          class class_name{<br>
            class_name(datatype value1, datatype value2){<br>
              //code to be executed<br>
            }<br>
            public static void main(String args[]){<br>

          <h1>Inheritance in Java</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent
          object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).<br><br>
          The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
          When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class.
          Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.<br><br>
          Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
        </p>
        <h4>Why use inheritance in java</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>For Method Overriding</li>
          <li>For Code Reusability</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Syntax for Java Inheritance</h4>
        <code>
